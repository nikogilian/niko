This is the full tutorial for code. So here is the full doctype for html. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>           Now, the head is were you store scripts and tittles and styles. the body area is the html area were you store the content.

<body>
</body>

</html>
Here is the js template for html because as you know everything comes down to html such as php css and js

<script>print=('hello world')</script>

Now, css is more of the fun code as css can let you do styles.

<style>body {
  background-color: blue;
}</style>

Now, here is were it gets tough a file script or website script heres an example.

<script src="website name here"></script>

or

<script src="file name here"></script>

So here is php now php is very tough to understand.

<?php
echo "php basics"
?>

now a php is a bit strange if your using it with normal html as it wont work if you just type 

<body>
  <?php
echo "Hello world"
?>
  as its a type of script not to add into a <script></script>
